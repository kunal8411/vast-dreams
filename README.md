## Approach for this project.

1)I have created this project using MERN stack. 

2)First I created a MongoDb database and store all the book's information in collections.(Books which are present in our inventory).

3) To get all the data from that MongoDb server I created one project in node.js and using express framework, retrive all details from server.

4)To get all the books information, created REST API and pass that API to my React framework. 

5)STo run the project you must run the node.js server so we can pass all the data to our frontend framework.

6)To run node.js code, clone the project which I have pushed into github. Below is the URL for node.js project.

GitHub link:-https://github.com/kunal8411/vastDreams-NodeJs-.git

7)In react, first I fetched all the information from API and store the information in state.

8)So, using react, on home page of application, user can see all the books which are present in inventory.

9)If user wants to search any book, he/she can seach the book on home page.

10)On header section user can see different categories ob books so, if user is interested in only looking for that category, he/she can click on category and can see all the books related to that category.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
